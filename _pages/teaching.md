 1. Developer and Co-Lead Instructor, *Jewish Ethics in the Age of Climate Change*, Spring 2022, undergraduate and graduate level.\\
 I co-created this course with Rabbi Ira Dounn from the Center for Jewish Life to examine the intersections between climate science and Jewish ethics. Combining scientific and religious texts, we center each session on a specific ethical dilemma in a climate-shaped world, including climate damages, losses, and restitution; just transitions and local vs. global responsibilities; and geoengineering & "playing God". We taught this course to 13 undergraduate and graduate students in Spring 2022, and it has been approved to be taught at Boston University in Fall 2023.\\
