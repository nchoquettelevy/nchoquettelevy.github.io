I view teaching as a core part of my responsibilities to equip students with an interdisciplinary skillset to build a more just and sustainable world. I especially enjoy teaching courses that help students integrate multiple frameworks and tools to address a real-world problem. At Princeton University and the University of Calgary, I have served as a teaching assistant in a variety of departments, including engineering and environmental studies. I have also co-developed a novel course, Jewish Ethics in the Age of Climate Change, which integrates scientific and religious texts to examine ethical dilemmas posed by a climate-shaped world.  

## Princeton University Courses

**Jewish Ethics in the Age of Climate Change**\
Developer and Co-Lead Instructor | Spring 2022 | Undergraduate and Graduate


I co-created this course with Rabbi Ira Dounn from the Center for Jewish Life to examine the intersections between climate science and Jewish ethics. Combining scientific and religious texts, we center each session on a specific ethical dilemma in a climate-shaped world, including climate damages, losses, and restitution; just transitions and local vs. global responsibilities; and geoengineering. We taught this course to 13 undergraduate and graduate students in Spring 2022, and it has been approved to be taught at Boston University in Fall 2023.

**ENV 367: Modelling the Earth System**\
Assistant Instructor | Fall 2020 (virtual) | Undergraduate

This course teaches students to use and customize a Python-based Earth Systems Model to evaluate strategies for long-term climate change mitigation. As an Assistant Instructor, I co-led tutorials on using the model, facilitated class discussion on the science and policy of climate change, and mentored students on their semester-long group projects. I also created and graded bi-weekly programming assignments, and graded final student projects. 

**ENE 372: Rapid Switch - The Energy Transition**\
Assistant Instructor | Spring 2020 (hybrid) | Undergraduate

This course provides students with an interdisciplinary toolset to evaluate energy systems transitions from technical, economic, political, and social perspectives. As an Assistant Instructor, I led weekly tutorials to help students practice tangible skills in energy balance calculations, dynamical systems analysis (using VenSim software), stakeholder mapping, and cost-benefit analysis. I also graded students' final projects.

## University of Calgary Courses

**Life Cycle Assessment for Professionals**\
Teaching Assistant | Summer 2011 (in-person) | Sustainability Professionals

**ENEE 503: Life Cycle Assessment**\
Teaching Assistant | Spring 2011 (in-person) | Undergraduate
