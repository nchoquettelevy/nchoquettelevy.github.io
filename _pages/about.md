Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Boston University in the [Earth & Environment Department](https://www.bu.edu/earth/). I obtained my PhD in [Public and International Affairs](https://cpree.princeton.edu/) from Princeton University in January 2023. My research analyzes policy approaches to secure rural livelihoods against rising climate risks, integrating methods such as agent-based modelling, game theory, and household surveys. I have conducted field research in Nepal's Chitwan Valley, and am working on participatory modelling projects with stakeholders in Senegal and Brazil's RÃ´ndonia State.

The main questions that underlie my research include:

1) How is climate change re-shaping rural-urban migration patterns?

2) What policies are most effective in helping smallholder farmers adapt to rising climate risks?

3) What governance principles are needed to help societies navigate deeply uncertain climate futures?

### For colleagues from PAA 2023, please feel free to view more information on my poster presentation [here](/files/12.01.2022_Wittgenstein_final.pdf).

I am always happy to chat about potential research collaborations; commenting on policy developments related to climate, migration, and agriculture; and navigating graduate school. Please feel free to get in touch at nclevy@bu.edu.
