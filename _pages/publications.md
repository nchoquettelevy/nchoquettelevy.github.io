Thalheimer, L.; **Choquette-Levy, N.**; and F. Garip. [Compound impacts from drought and structural vulnerability on human mobility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222017631), *iScience*, 25(12): 105491.\\
\
*We analyze the impacts of compound risks (i.e. multiple climate and social factors that threaten livelihoods) on migration responses to drought in Madagascar, Mexico, and Nepal.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Extreme dry events already disrupt populations’ ability to migrate. In a warming climate, compound drought events could amplify vulnerability and drive forced migration. Here, we contribute the first multi-method research design on societal impacts from compound drought events. We show how mobility patterns are shaped by the intersection of drought and social vulnerability factors in three drought-prone countries – Madagascar, Nepal, and Mexico. We find that internal migration in agricultural communities in Mexico increased by 14 to 24 basis points from 1991 to 2018 and will prospectively increase by 2 to 15 basis points in Nepal in case of a compound drought event in 2025. We show that consecutive drought events exacerbate structural vulnerabilities, limiting migrants’ adaptation options, including long-range migration. We conclude that the additional social pre-conditions, e.g., social isolation and lack of accurate information, ultimately limit migration as an adaptation option for households vulnerable to compound drought events.

## [Risk Transfer Policies and Climate-Induced Immobility among Smallholder Farmers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01205-4) 
**Choquette-Levy, N.**; Wildemeersch, M.; Oppenheimer, M.; and S. A. Levin (2021). Risk transfer policies and climate-induced immobility among smallholder farmers, *Nature Climate Change*, 11(12): 1046-1054.
\
*We develop a novel agent-based model to assess the efficacy of various risk transfer policies in promoting smallholder farmer resilience to rising climate risks, finding that a combination of cash and risk transfer policies is robust in expanding farmers' adaptive capacity.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Climate change is anticipated to impact smallholder farmer livelihoods substantially. However, empirical evidence is inconclusive regarding how increased climate stress affects smallholder farmers’ deployment of various livelihood strategies, including rural–urban migration. Here we use an agent-based model to show that in a South Asian agricultural community experiencing a 1.5 oC temperature increase by 2050, climate impacts are likely to decrease household income in 2050 by an average of 28%, with fewer households investing in both economic migration and cash crops, relative to a stationary climate. Pairing a small cash transfer with risk transfer mechanisms significantly increases the adoption of migration and cash crops, improves community incomes and reduces community inequality. While specific results depend on contextual factors such as risk preferences and climate risk exposure, these interventions are robust in improving adaptation outcomes and alleviating immobility, by addressing the intersection of risk aversion, financial constraints and climate impacts.

## [COPTEM: A Model to Investigate the Factors Driving Crude Oil Pipleine Transportation Emissions](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b03398)
**Choquette-Levy, N.**; Zhong, M.; MacLean, H.L.; and J. Bergerson (2018). COPTEM: A model to investigate the factors driving crude oil pipleine transportation emissions, *Environmental Science and Technology*, 52(1): 337-345.\
\
*We develop a fluid mechanics-based model to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with pipeline transportation of crude oil across North America, finding considerably greater variability in emissions intensity compared to previous studies.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Previous transportation fuel life cycle assessment studies have not fully accounted for the full variability in the crude oil transport stage, for example, transporting a light crude through a high-diameter pipeline, vs transporting a heavy crude through a small-diameter pipeline. We develop a first-principles, fluid mechanics-based crude oil pipeline transportation emissions model (COPTEM) that calculates the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with pipeline transport as a function of crude oil parameters, pipeline dimensions, and external factors. Additionally, we estimate the emissions associated with the full life cycle of pipeline construction, maintenance, and disposal. This model is applied to an inventory of 62 major Canadian and U.S. pipelines (capacity greater than 100 000 barrels/day) to estimate the variability of GHG emissions associated with pipeline transportation. We demonstrate that pipeline GHG emissions intensities range from 0.23 to 20.3 g CO2e/(bbl·km), exhibiting considerably greater variability than data reported in other studies. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the linear velocity of crude transport and pipeline diameter are the most impactful parameters driving this variability. To illustrate one example of how COPTEM can be used, we develop an energy efficiency gap analysis to investigate the possibilities for more efficient pipeline transport of crude oil.

## [Should Alberta Upgrade Oil Sands Bitumen? An Integrated Life Cycle Framework to Evaluate Energy Systems Investment Tradeoffs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421513003042)
**Choquette-Levy, N.**; MacLean, H.L.; and J.A. Bergerson (2013). Should Alberta upgrade oil sands bitumen? An integrated life cycle framework to evaluate energy systems investment tradeoffs, *Energy Policy*, 61: 78-87.\
\
*We integrate life cycle and cost-benefit analysis to assess the economic and environmental tradeoffs of upgrading oil sands crude oil to higher-quality synthetic crude oil under different carbon-price scenarios. We find that stakeholders with different perceptions of risk and emissions responsibilites will differ on whether the Canadian province of  Alberta should incentivize this technology, which became a salient public policy response to the perception that the province did not extract sufficient value from its natural resources.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
The inclusion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions costs in energy systems investment decision-making requires the development of a framework that accounts for GHG and economic tradeoffs. This paper develops such a framework by integrating partial cost–benefit analysis with life cycle assessment to explore the question of whether bitumen should be upgraded in the Canadian province of Alberta to produce synthetic crude oil (SCO), or blended with light hydrocarbons to produce lower-quality diluted bitumen (dilbit). The net present value (NPV) of these options is calculated from the stakeholder perspectives of the oil sands industry, the Alberta public, and a climate-concerned Alberta resident. This calculation includes monetized GHG emissions costs stemming from a hypothetical economy-wide GHG price, and a sensitivity analysis explores the effects of variations in technical and economic conditions on stakeholders’ preferences. We find that under most plausible sets of conditions, industry would prefer the dilution option, while the climate-concerned Alberta resident would prefer the upgrading option. In contrast, the preferences of the general Alberta public depend on the values of key variables (e.g., the SCO-dilbit price differential). Key drivers of differences among stakeholders’ preferences include different perceptions of risks and responsibilities for life cycle GHG emissions.
